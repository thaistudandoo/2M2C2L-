## Mathematical Model for Chemoimmunotherapy of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (2M2C2L)

About: In the various areas of cancer research, mathematical modeling, as well as computational implementation, are used as an important tool for analysis. Immunotherapy is considered one of the most promising treatments for some specific types of cancer, as presented in C. García-Fernández et al [1]. The combination of this technique with other types of treatments already used by medicine, arouse curiosity and motivation to study. This work seeks to use the knowledge of Computational Immunology to improve the understanding of the impact of immunochemotherapy in specific cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia using mathematical models of differential equations.

Math Model:

Denoting the number of cancer cells by N (neoplastic B-lymphocytes), the number of immune cells by
I (\healthy" T-lymphocytes) and the amount (or mass) of chemotherapeutic agent in the bloodstream
by Q.
